# Introduction to Python for Bioinformatics

In this course, targeted at PhD students in the biomedical sciences, participants will receive an introduction to the programming language [Python 3](https://www.python.org/). We will start with the basics (I/O, basic data structures, loops and conditions, functions, classes) and then introduce widely used packages for data manipulation, scientific computing, and visualization ([NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)). Finally, the course will provide a first glimpse at two widely used packages for the analysis of biological data ([Biopython](https://biopython.org/), [GSEAPY](https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)).

# Getting Started

All course materials are provided as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html). To run Jupyter Notebooks on your machine, install an [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) before the start of the course.

Now download the course material into a directory called `python-intro`. For this, either click on **Code â†’ Download ZIP**, or download the course material via [git](https://git-scm.com/): 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbblumenthal/python-intro
```

After downloading the course material, navigate to the `python-intro` directory and create a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment called **python-intro** with all dependencies:

```bash
cd python-intro
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can now activate the environment and connect it to your Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
conda activate python-intro
(python-intro) python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python-intro
```

Now you can open your first notebook as follows:

```bash
(python-intro) jupyter notebook 1_first_steps.ipynb
```

If the Notebook opens without any errors, you are ready for the course.

# Writing Python Scripts

The entire course is based on Jupyter Notebooks, but sometimes it is useful to write Python scripts that can be executed from a terminal. As an example, you can have a look at the script `log_transform.py` (just open it in any text editor). You can execute the script as follows:

```bash
(python-intro) python log_transform.py input/P53.txt output/P53_log_transformed.tsv --drop DESCRIPTION
```

 This will save a log-transformed version of the data saved in `input/P53.txt` in the file `output/P53_log_transformed.tsv` , where the column `DESCRIPTION` contained in the input file is discarded.
